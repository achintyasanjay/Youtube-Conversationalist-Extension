### Features:
- **Video Summarization:** Automatically summarizes videos and highlights the key points discussed, allowing users to quickly understand the main content without viewing the entire video.
- **Interactive Chat System:** Users can interact with the video content by asking questions at specific timestamps. This feature is under development and aims to make video content more accessible and engaging.

### How It Works:
1. **Audio Extraction:** The application fetches the audio track from the video using the YouTube API.
2. **Audio to Vector Conversion:** Using Deepgram, the audio is converted into textual data transcripts with timestamps for every word.
3. **Vector Search:** The embedded vectors are then generated by together.ai and stored and indexed in MongoDB Atlas cloud database instance. 
4. **Retrieving Information:** Utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI techniques to query the MongoDB Atlas Vector search and fetch responses to user prompts based on the video content.
5. **User Interface:** Finally, the frontend was built and hosted with Streamlit that integrates the model with the database for querying video information.

### Future Implementations:
- **Skill Level Summary and Chat:** Choose the depth of analysis and skill level you'd like in the summary and chat explanations
- **Emotion Analysis:** Identify and respond to the emotional content of the video
